# MusicInspires
This app is built specifically for people in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC) competition. It allows teams to identify what kind of music they listen to the most, and individual users to match music tastes with other members of the FTC community.

# How it works:
Using the Node.js and Express infrastructure, we use the API provided by Spotify to collect data and classify it by genre. When you fill in your team's international identifier, you get added to a database that avarages the music taste of all your team members and outputs the result. The social aspect of the app is defined bt its ability to match your music taste with the one of a member from another team, afterwards being able to contact them through other social mediums.
